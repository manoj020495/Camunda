Where does the exporter plugin pull the data from? Is it from ElasticSearch, or does it read directly from Zeebe’s internal RocksDB event stream?”
 
If it’s reading from the internal RocksDB log stream, is ElasticSearch only used for Operate/Tasklist/Optimize UI support?
If that’s the case, can we disable ElasticSearch completely in a production system if we are using a custom or official RDBMS exporter for data persistence?
