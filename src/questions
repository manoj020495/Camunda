Does the official RDBMS Exporter support retry mechanisms?
 
 
If a DB insert fails (e.g., due to a connection error), will the exporter retry later, or is the event lost permanently?
Are there configuration options for retry count, backoff time, etc.?
 

 
 
2. 📜 
Who is responsible for table creation?
 
 
Does the official RDBMS exporter automatically create required tables when connected to the database?
Or are users expected to create the schema manually?
If so, is there a reference .sql script or DDL available from Camunda for this exporter?
 

 
 
3. 🔐 
Where and how are DB credentials configured?
 
 
Is there a standard way to pass DB connection properties like URL, username, and password (e.g., in application.yaml, environment variables, or another config file)?
How are secure connections (e.g., SSL) supported for DB?
 

 
 
4. 📦 
What are the supported record types and events in the official RDBMS exporter?
 
 
Does it capture only UserTaskRecordValue, or does it also store process lifecycle events (ProcessInstanceRecordValue, VariableRecordValue, etc.)?
Any mapping reference for what tables each record type maps to?
 

 
 
5. 🚨 
What happens on exporter crash?
 
 
If the exporter crashes or throws an exception, what is the recovery mechanism?
Will missed events be picked up after broker restart?
 

 
 
6. 🧪 
How to test the exporter standalone?
 
 
Is there any support or approach for local/standalone testing of the exporter without restarting the whole broker every time?
Can we simulate the broker input to the exporter manually?
 

 
 
7. ⚠️ 
Are there any known limitations or risks?
 
 
Any caveats like memory overhead, DB locking issues, duplicate entries, or ordering problems?
How does it scale under high-throughput scenarios?
 

 
 
8. 🛠️ 
Is batching supported in the exporter?
 
 
Can we configure the exporter to batch insert operations into the DB for better performance?
 

 
 
9. 🧩 
Is there integration with Camunda Operate or Optimize?
 
 
If we use the RDBMS exporter, will it affect Camunda Operate/Optimize or work alongside them?
